# @cital/benchmark

**Welcome to the `@cital/benchmark`!**

This repository is an experimental space. There are no packages publicly released from here.

The purpose of this repository is to create a variety of prototypes for pursuing excellent architectures aimed at producing high-performance (like execution speed) libraries and to measure the performance of these prototypes through benchmarking.

The insights gained from this repository will be applied to the development of libraries in other repositories within the `citaljs` organization.
